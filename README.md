# weatherapp
A minimalistic current weather app

This is a single page application to get the current weather on your city using your browsers geolocation, you can also use the search bar to get 
the current weather for any city in the world.

This is a basic skills coding project, i'm planning on making it grow. 
For the next versions i'll add suggestions of cities on the search bar and the option for extended forecast up to 8 days.

It is made in python 3.10 with Flask, Javascript, HTML, Boostrap, CSS and uses openweathermap.org API to get the weather info.

Instructions:
Go to https://openweathermap.org to make an account and get an API Key, then add it to API_KEY.json file for it to work.
